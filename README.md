# ProjectionsProject
Class project for the Coursera Data Products course

This repository contains a _shiny_ app produced for the Coursera _Developing Data Products_ course in the _Data Science_ specialization: https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod

The app itself comprises two R scripts: _ui.R_ and _server.R_; one of the data frames it uses is stored in _survivorship.csv_.

The active version of the app is hosted on RStudio's shiny apps server: https://bugbunny.shinyapps.io/ProjectionsProject

There is a five page presentation motivating the app available on gitio: http://bugbunny.github.io/ProjectionsProject/

The script was written using R 3.2.2 under Windows 7 SP1.

# ProjectionsProject
### Class project for _Developing Data Products_

This repository contains a _shiny_ app produced for the Coursera _Developing Data Products_ course in the _Data Science_ specialization: https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod

The app computes population projections for the United Kingdom covering the period 2015-50 using forecasts of total fertility selected by the user. It can produce a population pyramid for the mid- or end-point of any decade in this period selected by the user.

The code for the app comprises two R scripts: _ui.R_ and _server.R_; one of the data frames it uses is stored in _survivorship.csv_.

The active version of the app is hosted on RStudio's shiny apps server: https://bugbunny.shinyapps.io/ProjectionsProject

There is a five page presentation motivating the app available on gitio: http://bugbunny.github.io/ProjectionsProject/

The scripts were developed using R 3.2.2 under Windows 7 SP1.
